#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.  

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1. Software Engineering  and its importance

Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to software development. It involves designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software in a structured and efficient manner.

Importance in the Technology Industry:

Ensures reliability, scalability, and efficiency in software systems.
Reduces costs and time through structured development processes.
Helps manage complexity in large-scale software projects.
Ensures software meets user requirements and industry standards.


2. Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering

1950s-1960s: Birth of Software Engineering – The term "software engineering" was first used in a NATO conference in 1968 to address the "software crisis."

1970s-1980s: Structured Programming & Waterfall Model – Introduction of structured programming techniques and the first formal software development methodologies.

2000s-Present: Agile and DevOps – Agile methodologies emerged for faster development cycles, and DevOps integrated development with operations to improve deployment and reliability.

3. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

a. Requirement Analysis – Gather and define software requirements.
b. Design – Create system architecture and design specifications.
c. Implementation (Coding) – Develop the actual software.
d. Testing – Verify that the software meets requirements.
e. Deployment – Release the software to users.
f. Maintenance – Provide updates and fix issues.

4. Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies

Waterfall is Suitable for projects with well-defined requirements, such as banking systems while Agile is Best for dynamic projects like mobile app development, where requirements evolve.

5. Roles in a Software Engineering Team

Software Developer: Writes and maintains code, implements features, and debugs.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Tests software, identifies bugs, ensures quality.

Project Manager: Manages timelines, team coordination, and client communication.


6. Importance of IDEs and Version Control Systems (VCS)

Integrated Development Environments (IDEs): Provide tools for writing, debugging, and testing code 

Version Control Systems (VCS): Track code changes, enable collaboration for example GitHub 

7. Common Challenges in Software Engineering.

a. Managing complexity → Solution: Use modular design and documentation.

b. Meeting deadlines → Solution: Use Agile and project management tools.

C. Debugging and testing → Solution: Implement automated testing.


8. Types of Software Testing and Their Importance

a. Unit Testing – Tests individual components (ensures correctness at the function level).

b. Integration Testing – Ensures different modules work together correctly.

c. System Testing – Validates the complete system’s functionality.

d. Acceptance Testing – Confirms software meets user expectations before deployment.
   
Part 2: 

1.  Prompt Engineering and  it Important

Prompt engineering is the process of designing and refining text inputs to get accurate and useful responses from AI models. It is essential for improving AI interactions, optimizing efficiency, and ensuring clear outputs.

2. Example of Improving a Prompt

Vague Prompt: "Tell me about planets."

Improved Prompt: "List the eight planets in the solar system and describe their key characteristics
reasons why improved prompt is  better
It is specific 
It provides clear expectations 
It ensures concise and relevant output
